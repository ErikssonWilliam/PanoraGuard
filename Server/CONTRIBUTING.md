# Server Code Documentation Standard

When writing code in Python, developers should adhere to these documentation standards.

## File Header

At the top of a file, above any imports, provide a concise description of the file's purpose.

### Example File Header:

```python
"""
This file provides utility functions for basic arithmetic operations, including addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division. The functions are designed to support both
integer and floating-point values and return the corresponding results.
"""
```

## Function Documentation

For each function, below the `def` line, provide a description of the function's purpose, parameters, returns and any important details.

### Example Function Description:

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Function that computes the sum of two integers.

    Parameters:
        a (int): The first integer.
        b (int): The second integer.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b
```

## Route Documentation

For each route, below the `def` line, provide a description of the route's purpose and any important details. If parameters are passed in the URL, an example request should be provided. If data is sent in the request body, an example request body should be provided.

### Example Route Description:

```python
@app.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_user(user_id):
    """
    Route for updating the information of an existing user.

    URL Parameters:
        user_id (int): The unique identifier of the user to be updated.

    Example Request:
        PUT /users/123

    Example Request Body:
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com",
            "age": 31
        }
    """
```

## Comments

When necessary, use comments to explain non-obvious logic. For example, to describe the purpose of an if-statement or to clarify the role of a variable if it is not obvious from its name. Use `#` for brief single-line comments and `""" ... """` for longer multi-line comments.

**NOTE:** Comments should only be used when they add value. Commenting obvious code is redundant and can reduce code readability. Additionally, when updating code, comments must also be updated. Too many comments increase the risk of leaving outdated or misleading comments in the code.
