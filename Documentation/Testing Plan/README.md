# Testing Plan

## Overview

This document details the comprehensive testing strategy for a software development project undertaken in collaboration with Axis for the TDDC88 Software Engineering Theory and Practice course at Link√∂ping University. It outlines various testing methodologies, including unit, system, user experience, and acceptance testing, and emphasizes automated testing using a Git pipeline. The plan also addresses potential risks and mitigation strategies, ensuring a robust and user-centric final product.
