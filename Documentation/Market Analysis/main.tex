\hline
\textbf{Force} & \textbf{Analysis} \\
\hline
Threat of New Entrants \newline (Medium) & 
High capital requirements and R\&D investment (15\% of annual revenue) create significant barriers \cite{axis_newsroom2023}. However, rapid market growth (CAGR 12.4\% 2023-2030) may attract entrants \cite{grandview2023}. \\
\hline
Bargaining Power of Suppliers \newline (Low to Medium) & 
Axis's size (\$1.6B revenue in 2022) provides leverage. Efficient supply chain management evident in 94\% of products having two-week delivery \cite{axis_newsroom2023}. \\
\hline
Bargaining Power of Buyers \newline (Medium) & 
Diverse buyer range with varying power. Multiple vendors available (e.g., Hikvision, Dahua) \cite{stellar2023}. Axis's brand reputation may offset some buyer power for high-quality solutions. \\

\subsubsection{Need}
With increasing concerns about security, theft, and public safety, both businesses and public spaces require effective surveillance systems to protect assets, monitor activities, and ensure safety. This need spans various sectors, including retail, transportation, healthcare, government buildings, and critical infrastructure, where security breaches or unauthorized access can have significant financial and operational consequences. 

\subsubsection{Approach}
%DRAFT
To be written after requirements are set

\subsubsection{Benefit}
The surveillance system increases security by allowing for real-time alarms being raised by the detection of suspicious activity, while normal activity being filtered away. This would allow security personnel to immediate alerts to security guards to the correct sight. The flexible monitoring through web-applications also supporting mobile devices reduces the need for large on-premises hardware and IT infrastructure, lowering overall costs. The system is also built with robust quality and security protocols to protect data from breaches and comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR.

\subsubsection{Competition}
Competitors like Hikvision, Dahua Technology, and Uniview offer similar surveillance systems, not unlikely at competitive price points. These companies provide a wide range of cameras and solutions, but Axis differentiates itself by offering a premium, high-quality product tailor made for the customers.

Axis Communications, a leader in the network video surveillance industry, aims to maintain its competitive position by focusing on innovative, high-quality products and services, especially in emerging areas like AI integration, cloud-based solutions, and cybersecurity.

The analysis highlights key factors influencing Axis Communications, including regulatory concerns like GDPR, economic growth in the global surveillance market, privacy issues, and advancements in AI and cloud-based solutions. Axis faces moderate threats from new market entrants and intense competition from rivals like Hikvision and Dahua. Strengths such as global presence and market leadership when focusing on large enterprises and SMBs, Axis is positioning itself as a premium, innovative brand using AI and cloud technology. The NABC framework underscores the demand for advanced surveillance systems and Axis’s competitive advantage through high-quality, customizable solutions.

In conclusion, Axis is well-positioned to capitalize on market growth and technological trends, though challenges like privacy concerns and strong competition require strategic focus.
