Utilizing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Our CI/CD pipeline, managed through GitLab CI, includes automated testing, Docker image building, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster hosted in Azure. This approach ensures consistent code quality, frequent integration, and reliable deployments.

Maintaining code quality through review processes before merging major features into our main codebase. We aim for comprehensive automated testing coverage for all new code, ensuring reliability.

Soliciting regular stakeholder feedback, with dedicated sessions throughout the project. This approach ensures that we remain aligned with stakeholder expectations and can adapt to changing requirements or priorities.

Conducting sprint retrospectives after each iteration to evaluate our practices and processes, as outlined in our quality management plan. These retrospectives will cover areas such as document version handling, internal test cases, code refactoring, methods of communication, and the retrospective process itself.

Implementing a feedback loop system where all employees are encouraged to provide continuous feedback and recommendations on quality assurance practices to their Lead, Line Manager, or the Project Manager.

Through these quality objectives and processes, we aim to deliver a security surveillance solution that maintains high standards of quality throughout its development lifecycle.
