    \item Security managers overseeing operations and accessing analytical data
    \item System administrators managing access and configurations
\end{itemize}
    

    
\subsection{Project Constraints}
    
\subsubsection{Personnel}
The project is constrained by a 160-hour limit per team member. This necessitates careful planning and resource management throughout the project lifecycle. Additionally, team members have other academic commitments inherent to being students, which must be respected and managed alongside project work. This differs from a traditional work environment and requires flexible scheduling and efficient time utilization.
    
\subsubsection{Timeline}
The timeline of the project requires management of development cycles and regular progress reviews to ensure in-time delivery of project milestones. The project is bound by the following key dates:
    
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{Event} & \textbf{Date} \\
    \hline
        Project Start & September 4, 2024 \\
        Tollgate Meeting & September 26, 2024 \\
        Iteration 1 End & October 11, 2024 \\
        Iteration 2 End & November 8, 2024 \\
        Iteration 3 End & November 22, 2024 \\
        Iteration 4 End & December 6, 2024 \\
        VSSE (Final Presentation) & December 12, 2024 \\
\end{tabular}

    
\subsubsection{Resources}
The project operates without a dedicated budget, which significantly impacts available resources. Key constraints include:
    
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reliance on virtual environments for large-scale testing scenarios
    \item No funds for third-party software licenses, AI models, or cloud computing resources
    \item Time constraints for students in our company
    \item Time limitations for learning new technologies or frameworks
\end{itemize}
    
To address these constraints, the team will focus on open-source tools, efficient resource utilization, and prioritization of core functionalities. Open communication with Axis Communications and the course adminstration will be maintained for any critical support or resources needed for project success.

\subsubsection{Competence Plan}
To ensure effective use of the resources in the company a competence plan has been made. This includes providing various learning tools to enhance team competence. These resources include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Course material} - labs, lectures, and exercises from course materials available and attended to all company members.
    \item \textbf{Company lectures} - One introduction to C was held by Magnus Nielsen, but this was the only lecture expressively needed by the development team.
    \item \textbf{Self-learning modules} - the main method of competence development is individual. This is to encourage continuous development and estimation of what the individual needs to execute their respective task.
    \item \textbf{Education tag in Planner} - operation to track and give an overview of knowledge in the company. 
\end{itemize}

Through the plan, each team member and group is encouraged to proactively anticipate their future learning needs. This may involve diverse knowledge areas, such as requirements gathering, testing, traceability, integration, deployment in Docker or Azure, and more.

To maintain a clear record of the knowledge within the company, all employees are encouraged to log their learning and assignments as tasks in our project planner. By tagging these entries with "education," we can trace and reference the expertise within the company for future reuse.

\subsubsubsection{Gap Analysis}
To have an initial understanding of the existing competence in the company, a gap analysis was performed using \textit{assignments} through Microsoft Teams. This analysis focused on key areas of knowledge, particularly in "programming" and "git." Skills were assessed using the following levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Level 1 ‚Äì Assists}: Basic understanding of the concepts and the ability to follow instructions.
    \item \textbf{Level 2 ‚Äì Applies}: Can apply the concepts in simple contexts by routinely using prior experience.
    \item \textbf{Level 3 ‚Äì Masters}: Can apply the concepts in most contexts and has the experience to work without supervision.
    \item \textbf{Level 4 ‚Äì Adapts}: Possesses judgment on when and how to apply the concepts in more complex contexts. Can enable others to apply the concepts.
    % \item \textbf{Level 5 ‚Äì (optional)}: Please check lecture notes for any additional levels.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Onboarding New Groups and Team Members}
When a new team member joins or an existing employee is assigned to a new role, onboarding procedures include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assignment to a cross-functional team for active participation.
    \item Assignment of mentors to facilitate the transition into the new role.
\end{itemize}

Special considerations are given to the remaining project time for relocated employees relative to the average time remaining for other team members. For example, analysts transitioning into developer roles with less time left are given tasks that are either less time-consuming or fewer in number.

If additional resources are required for a functional group, the project manager decides on personnel redistribution. Line managers, with input from the group, make employees available as needed. This process is primarily used when re-distributing roles. 

\subsubsubsection{Follow-up}
To assess the effectiveness of this competence plan, a poll will be conducted at the end of iteration 2. Employees will be asked if they feel adequately equipped with the knowledge required to complete their tasks, whether the self-learning approach has been beneficial, and if there are specific areas where further training would be helpful. A poll is exemplified in Image \ref{fig:competence_follow_up}
 below.

\subsection{Quality Objectives}

Quality is at the heart of our development process, encompassing both the product we deliver and the methods we employ to create it.

\subsubsection{Product Quality}

Our security surveillance solution aims to meet the following quality benchmarks:

% Need to confirm specific quality metrics with stakeholders
% @Emma: Please confirm the quality metrics
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieve high system uptime during operational hours.
    \item Generate alerts within a specified time frame of incident detection.
    \item Maintain a low false positive rate for security alerts.
    \item Design an intuitive interface for efficient user interaction.
    \item Support multiple simultaneous camera feeds.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Process Quality}

% @Chioma: Please confirm the rnd side of things here 
To ensure an effective development process, we commit to:

Adhering to iterative development methodologies, with regular reviews and retrospectives to continuously improve our processes. Our documentation will be updated at the conclusion of each iteration to reflect the latest project state.

Implementing a comprehensive Quality Assurance plan that is iterative in nature, with a focus on continuous improvement. This plan spans across both the Research and Development (RnD) and Product and Sales (PnS) departments, covering all iterations. Key roles and responsibilities are outlined in Table \ref{tab:qa-responsibilities}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Quality Assurance Roles and Responsibilities}
\label{tab:qa-responsibilities}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Responsibility} \\
\hline
Product and Sales Line Manager & Overall QA plan \\
Technical Writer & Document structure and version control \\
Testing Lead & Testing strategy and bug tracking \\
Analysis Lead & Traceability \\
Deployment Lead & Continuous integration and delivery \\
Process Manager & Internal quality practices and change management \\
Architecture & Future development and operations considerations \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Utilizing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Our CI/CD pipeline, managed through GitLab CI, includes automated testing, Docker image building, and deployment to a Kubernetes cluster hosted in Azure. This approach ensures consistent code quality, frequent integration, and reliable deployments.

Maintaining code quality through review processes before merging major features into our main codebase. We aim for comprehensive automated testing coverage for all new code, ensuring reliability.

Soliciting regular stakeholder feedback, with dedicated sessions throughout the project. This approach ensures that we remain aligned with stakeholder expectations and can adapt to changing requirements or priorities.

Conducting sprint retrospectives after each iteration to evaluate our practices and processes, as outlined in our quality management plan. These retrospectives will cover areas such as document version handling, internal test cases, code refactoring, methods of communication, and the retrospective process itself.

Implementing a feedback loop system where all employees are encouraged to provide continuous feedback and recommendations on quality assurance practices to their Lead, Line Manager, or the Project Manager.

Through these quality objectives and processes, we aim to deliver a security surveillance solution that maintains high standards of quality throughout its development lifecycle.
