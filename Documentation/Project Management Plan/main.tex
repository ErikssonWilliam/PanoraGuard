\textit{Technical Writer Note: This document is work in progress. It demonstrates the direction we're going with the plan, it's a living document that is always in progress. Retroactive imporovements will be done.}

This document serves as the master plan for Company 3's development project in collaboration with Axis Communications AB. It outlines our systematic approach to project execution, monitoring, and control while ensuring alignment with both customer requirements and course objectives.

The Project Management Plan (PMP) defines how we organize our work across departments, manage resources, and implement key software engineering practices. It provides a comprehensive framework for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Project process definition and control
    \item Resource allocation and monitoring
    \item Milestone planning and tracking
    \item Cross-functional team coordination
    \item Quality assurance and risk management
\end{itemize}

This document is maintained throughout the project lifecycle and serves as a reference point for all team members, linking to specialized plans such as the Quality Assurance Plan, Testing Plan, and Risk Management Plan. Regular updates will reflect our evolving understanding and improvements to our processes.

- Processes and working method (Olle)
    -The plan is to create an visual chart representing the main process in the company, in the form of the flow from requirments to a delivered product/function. This will begin the process chapter and will also includa a descriptive text written me (Olle) and the analysts.

        - Text:
            The following diagram illustrates the core process within our company for delivering a product according to customer specifications. This workflow forms the foundation of our project approach, as it provides a structured method to incorporate customer needs effectively into the final product. Consequently, any changes or adjustments to project scope are handled through this main process, as an integral part of meeting the agreed-upon specifications.
            
            The process begins with the customer submitting input on new or adjusted requirements. These requirements are first assessed by a team of analysts, who formalize them into a specification and add it to the product backlog. The requirements are then prioritized; if approved, they proceed to the development team. Otherwise, they are returned to the analysts for refinement and re-evaluation.
            
            Once the prioritized requirements are approved, they are added to the development backlog and may be broken down into smaller tasks, or subrequirements. From here, the development team implements the necessary changes, while the testing team prepares to validate the functionality. After development, testing ensures the new functionality meets quality standards. If any functionality fails the tests, it returns to the development team for adjustments. Upon successful testing, the functionality is presented to the customer for final approval.
            
            One notable limitation of this workflow is that customer satisfaction is necessary to conclude the process. If the customer is not satisfied, the feedback loop directs the process back to the analysts for a new cycle of adjustments. Only when the customer is satisfied and grants approval does the finalized version proceed to deployment. This workflow, therefore, prioritizes alignment with customer expectations over rapid completion.

    -After presenting the overal process, the main working methods (wich contains processes) will be reffered to according to below:
        - Testing : Test plan (https://www.overleaf.com/project/66ff9154fca1f68722259739)
        - Error handling: Described in the Testing plan, section "Bug Handling Process" (https://www.overleaf.com/project/66ff9154fca1f68722259739)
        - Handling of risks: Risk managment plan (https://www.overleaf.com/project/66e6db3848ba4493cf2e8b34)
        - Git: Described in Git (https://gitlab.liu.se/tddc88-ht24/company3/-/blob/development/README.md?ref_type=heads)
        - Change management: Is described in Quality Assurance Plan, section "Change Management"
