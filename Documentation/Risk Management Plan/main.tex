\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that may arise during the execution of our software engineering project with Axis Communications. The risk management ensures that the project progresses smoothly, remains on schedule, and stays within the allocated budget. By proactively addressing potential challenges, we aim to minimize disruptions and maximize the likelihood of project success.

This document outlines the framework for identifying, categorizing, and responding to risks associated with the project, including technical, financial, operational, and resource-related risks. As students working on this project, we recognize that uncertainties may emerge from several factors such as limited technical expertise, resource constraints, and external dependencies.

The Risk Management Plan provides a structured approach to handling these uncertainties by detailing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk Identification}: A systematic process to identify and document potential risks that could impact the project.
    \item \textbf{Risk Description}: An explanation of each identified risk to give more context.
    \item \textbf{Risk Analysis}: A quantitative evaluation of identified risks to understand their likelihood and impact.
    \item \textbf{Risk Planning}: Actions and contingency plans to reduce the impact or likelihood of high-priority risks.
    \item \textbf{Risk Monitoring}: Ongoing evaluation of risks throughout the project lifecycle to adapt to new challenges.
\end{itemize}

By following this Risk Management Plan, our team is committed to staying proactive and adaptable in handling risks that may affect our progress.

\section{Risk Identification}

Through the Risk Breakdown Structure below, potential risks that may impact the project are identified, categorized, and described for further analysis and mitigation.

\section{Risk Description}

As the diagram above illustrates, the project risk can be divided into six prominent areas:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Staffing Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quitting Members:} Team members leaving before project completion can cause delays and quality issues.
    \item \textbf{Conflicts:} Disagreements among team members can hinder collaboration and productivity.
    \item \textbf{Communication Issues:} Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings and project delays.
    \item \textbf{Different Ambitions:} Varying levels of commitment and goals among members may lead to disagreements.
    \item \textbf{Illness:} Health issues lead to unexpected absences.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Security Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GDPR Compliance:} Non-compliance with data protection regulations can result in legal issues.
    \item \textbf{Data Breaches:} Inadequate safeguards expose sensitive information.
    \item \textbf{User Negligence:} Human error increases the risk of breaches.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Technical Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Technology Employed:} Dependency on third-party tools that may become deprecated or unsupported.
    \item \textbf{Technical Processes:} Risk of losing critical code due to lack of version management.
    \item \textbf{Scaling Technology:} Infrastructure might fail to scale effectively under high load or multiple users.
    \item \textbf{Testing:} Limitations in testing environments may affect the ability to test all scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Requirement Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scope and Objectives:} Misunderstandings lead to unmet expectations.
    \item \textbf{Miscommunication:} Lack of clarity causes project delays.
    \item \textbf{Failure to Meet Expectations:} Discrepancies between deliverables and requirements.
    \item \textbf{Scope Creep:} Uncontrolled addition of features without adjusting timelines or resources.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Estimation Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inaccurate Time Estimates:} Underestimating time required for tasks can cause missed deadlines.
    \item \textbf{Underestimation of Complexity:} Tasks may be simpler than they seem, leading to unexpected development issues.
    \item \textbf{Insufficient Buffer:} Lack of contingency time for unexpected issues.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Task Breakdown:} Unclear tasks complicate time management.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\subsection{Organizational Risk}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unclear Responsibilities:} Ambiguity in roles can cause misalignment and missed deadlines.
    \item \textbf{Unclear Role Definition:} Hesitation in decision-making hampers progress.
    \item \textbf{Task Overload:} Burnout decreases productivity and morale.
    \item \textbf{Decision-Making Bottlenecks:} Delays occur when too few people make decisions.
    \item \textbf{Individual Time Tracking:} Tracking of individual effort through a common time report may be misused, leading to uneven workloads. This unfairness could cause frustration between employees. Currently, each individual must weekly report the time spent on the project each day. Since this is a manual and independent task, an employee might forget to log time or log time they havenâ€™t actually worked.
\end{itemize}

\section{Risk Analysis}
To assess risks, both probability and impact are rated on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 denoting the lowest level and 4 the highest. The overall risk magnitude is determined by multiplying the probability by the impact, producing a value ranging from 1 to 16.
\[
\text{Risk Magnitude} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Impact}
\]

\section{Risk Planning}

The Risk Planning details proactive strategies for managing identified risks throughout the project. By implementing these measures, the project aims to minimize potential disruptions and ensure successful outcomes. Among the various risks we face, employee sickness stands out as one of the most significant. This underscores the necessity of having a robust contingency plan in place, ensuring that we can adapt and respond effectively to any health-related challenges that may arise.

\subsection{Contingency Plan}
\label{sec:contingency}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item The project member should contact their direct manager or project manager as soon as possible, preferably before their shift starts.  

    \item The direct manager or project manager notes the project member's name, date of notification, and reason for absence.  

    \item The direct manager or project manager assesses the project memberâ€™s current workload and identifies tasks that need immediate attention.  

    \item Assign the project member's tasks to other team members to ensure work continues without major disruptions.  

    \item Notify the team about the project memberâ€™s absence and the temporary redistribution of their duties without disclosing personal details. If necessary, inform the CEO or examiner of any changes or delays.  

    \item Remind the project member to focus on their health and recovery. Share information about health resources or employee assistance programs.  

    \item After a few days, the direct manager or project manager should reach out to see how the project member is feeling and discuss their return to work.  

    \item Ensure the project member is fit to return before they come back. 

    \item After the project member returns, discuss what went well and what could be improved in the response to their absence.  
\end{enumerate}

Apart from risks related to illness, the strategies for the previously mentioned risks are as follows:

\section{Risk Monitoring}

Ongoing evaluation and monitoring of risks will be conducted to ensure that mitigation strategies are effective and to address new risks as they emerge throughout the project lifecycle.

IMAGINE A TABLE ABOUT CURRENT RISKS


\subsection{Measurement of Individual Time Tracking: }
On each Manager meeting, held on Monday lunch, the Project Manager and the Line Managers follow up the past weeks hours spent on the project and compare different groups, teams, and individual situations, to assess if the time spent is fair and in accordance to the expectations for that time frame. Th Process Manager has therefore constructed individual burn-down charts for each employee. 

After the Pre-Study phase and Iteration 1 it is clear that some groups have spent more time on the project, especially the Managers and the Analysts. However, this is to be expected as groups, such as, Developers and Testers have tasks more prominent in later iterations.
