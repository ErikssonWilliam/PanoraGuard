# Customer Requirements Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the customer requirements for a surveillance system being developed by Company 3 in collaboration with Axis Communications during the TDDC88 Software Engineering course at Link√∂ping University. It details user needs, system functionalities, constraints, and serves as the foundation for the design and development process, adhering to the IEEE 830-1998 standard. This iteration focuses on restructuring the document to improve clarity and traceability of requirements.
